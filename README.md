# Voxel Game

- FPS camera
- context refactor? it might be ok atm
- texturing modes: everything is minimum or ones where its just one
   - and other shit like crops

- different blocks modes like walk thru or not, transparency
- chunk paging, loading visible etc.

## Optimization
- Greedy meshing
   - to do texturing: need to do modulo of tex coords in frag shader
   - AO at the same time its a similar calculation

- How much of this data do i actually need to be sending to the GPU, for instance can normals be calced, texture coordinates, can it all just be done in a mesh shader from the raw blocks? nah gotta mesh
- all 1 type chunks

## Micro world gen
- how about cliffs and caves. maybe use a small amount of 3d?
- domain warping?
- ridge noise
- how to do trees? minecraft style or not. ultimately like to not and have some cool L system shit. L system coconut palm tree. oo climbing up it

### Features
- volcano
- terraces
- flat with mounds

## Macro world gen
- maybe diamond square? or some continenty thing or grammar thing... idk
   world map visualizer, make a mesh and have it spinning and stuff. like kart racer character select
- gradient info for erosion, fluid calcs

## Assets
- snow and dirt to spruce up world gen
- wood

## debug info
- looking at block

Thu 2 Jul Signoff

 - fixed reticle
   - in the process got testing infrastructure, debuggin infrastructure, 2d image drawing

 - fixed empty chunks not being upgraded to real chunks
   - should we be able to downgrade? I doubt it, who cares
   - though not sure if the optimization does anything as ram usage doesnt go up when we build into a new once empty chunk

 - fixed ram usage
   - now world can be way bigger. greedy meshing will still be a huge improvement

 - block highlighting
   - rn its wireframe, could be a bit prettier, can u make line thicker
   - yes but it still looks shit lol. maybe alpha and solid colour

 - refactoring
   - graphics - input split
   - chunk - world split

Up next:
 * how to turn off vsync?
 * world treadmill: replace chunks as u move through the world
 * 3d perlin worldgen
 * opts backface culling
 * greedy meshing + ao
 * physics, fps cam (lets do arena shooter speed)
 * console
