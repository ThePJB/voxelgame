Up next:
 * how to turn off vsync?
 * world treadmill: replace chunks as u move through the world
 * 3d perlin worldgen
 * opts backface culling
 * greedy meshing + ao
 * physics, fps cam (lets do arena shooter speed)
 * console




Light todos:
------------
 - get the infinity other cases working
  - remove light
  - place/remove block
  - skylight
 - gamma it so theres a nice long and smoooth falloff like IRL
 - its really a pest that chunks are interdependent

 then do skylights maybe

 then do removing lights

 then do AO and greedy meshes



 hey in t he witching hour can we like divide all light levels by 4 or something
 could probably do that in shader with a uniform tbh

Block lighting seems to entirely work, up next is sky lighting

then AO and greedy meshing

or maybe world map screen if i want a break from this tricky stuff
